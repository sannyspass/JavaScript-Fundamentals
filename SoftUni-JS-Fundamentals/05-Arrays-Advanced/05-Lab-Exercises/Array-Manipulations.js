/*8. Array Manipulations

Write a function that manipulates an array of numbers.

· Add {number}: add a number to the end of the array

· Remove {number}: remove number from the array

· RemoveAt {index}: removes number at a given index

· Insert {number} {index}: inserts a number at a given index

Note: All the indices will be valid!

Print the final state of the array (separated by single space).

The input comes as array of strings. First element will be a string containing the array to manipulate. Every other command you receive will also be a string.

The output is the manipulated array printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

Example

Input Output

['4 19 2 53 6 43',

'Add 3',

'Remove 2',

'RemoveAt 1',

'Insert 8 3'] 4 53 6 8 43 3

Hints

First we receive the whole input:

· After that we take the first element from the commands and convert it to an array of numbers:

· Then we loop through the commands array and obtain each element from the command and cast both numbers. This event is called destructuring:

· We check if the command is equal to one of the given: "Add", "Remove", etc.

· To add element at the end, use push()

· To remove all occurrences of a particular element from the array, you can use filter()

· To remove or insert at an index, you can use splice()

Note: Removing elements with splice() receives two parameters:

· Start Index

· Count of elements you want to remove

Note: Inserting elements with splice() receives three parameters:

· Start Index

· Count of elements to remove – if none enter 0

· Elements to insert at that position*/
